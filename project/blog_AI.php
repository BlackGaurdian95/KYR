    <p><em>As artificial intelligence reshapes legal services, a new question emerges: how do we uphold time-tested ethical standards in a digital-first, algorithm-powered world?</em></p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Confidentiality Meets the Cloud</h2>
    <p>Lawyers are ethically bound to protect client confidentiality. But when using cloud-based AI platforms for research, drafting, or analysis, sensitive information might be exposed to third-party providers.</p>
    <p>Best practices demand thorough vetting of AI tools, ensuring they comply with security, data retention, and client privacy standards.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Redefining Competence in the Tech Age</h2>
    <p>Ethical competence now means more than knowing the law‚Äîit includes understanding the technology being used. A lawyer relying on AI tools without understanding their limitations risks misinforming clients or producing flawed work.</p>
    <p>Several jurisdictions, including California and the ABA, now emphasize ‚Äútechnological competence‚Äù as part of a lawyer‚Äôs duty.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Bias & Algorithmic Accountability</h2>
    <p>AI models are often trained on biased historical data, meaning they can replicate or even amplify systemic discrimination. Legal professionals must actively question how an algorithm functions, what data it uses, and whether its outputs are just.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Predictive policing</strong> tools have faced backlash for racial profiling.</li>
      <li><strong>Risk assessments in sentencing</strong> often lack transparency and fairness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Client Communication & Transparency</h2>
    <p>Should clients be told when AI is used to draft documents or conduct research? Ethically, yes. Informed consent now includes awareness of when technology is acting on behalf of their legal counsel.</p>
    <p>Clients deserve clarity on how much of their case is handled by a human versus an algorithm.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Ownership & the Unauthorized Practice of Law</h2>
    <p>Who owns AI-generated work? Can non-lawyers use legal AI tools to serve the public? As AI blurs professional boundaries, these questions become more urgent.</p>
    <p>Legal tech startups must be cautious to avoid offering unauthorized legal advice. Similarly, law firms must not allow AI to replace independent legal judgment.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Legal professionals stand at a crossroads: adopt AI without reflection, or integrate it ethically and responsibly. Upholding integrity, competence, and client trust in the AI age requires continuous learning and clear boundaries.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      ü§ñ Just because AI can do something, doesn‚Äôt mean it should. The law needs ethics now more than ever.
