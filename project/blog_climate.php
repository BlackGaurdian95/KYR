  <div class="blog-content">
    <p><em>As the climate crisis accelerates, courtrooms are becoming new battlegrounds for justice. Around the world, citizens and organizations are turning to climate litigation to hold corporations and governments accountable for environmental harm.</em></p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">What is Climate Litigation?</h2>
    <p>Climate litigation refers to legal action taken to address issues related to climate change. This includes lawsuits against governments for weak climate policies, against corporations for pollution, and even cases demanding recognition of a clean and healthy environment as a human right.</p>

    <p>Notable examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Urgenda v. Netherlands</strong> – Court forced the government to cut emissions based on human rights violations.</li>
      <li><strong>Shell v. Milieudefensie</strong> – Shell was ordered to reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Why Is It Growing?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inaction from policymakers</strong> is pushing activists to take legal routes.</li>
      <li><strong>Better scientific evidence</strong> now makes it easier to prove harm from emissions.</li>
      <li><strong>Youth-led movements</strong> and Indigenous voices are gaining legal traction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">New Legal Frontiers</h2>
    <p>Modern climate lawsuits are using creative legal angles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Human rights frameworks</strong> to argue for clean air and water.</li>
      <li><strong>Corporate greenwashing cases</strong> to stop false environmental advertising.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal rights for future generations</strong> — a revolutionary shift in environmental law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Challenges Ahead</h2>
    <p>Climate litigation isn't easy. Many cases are dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction or political interference. Large companies also have powerful legal teams and can drag cases for years.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The courtroom is now a key climate arena. Climate litigation is helping shape stronger laws, set global precedents, and empower communities demanding environmental justice. It’s clear that the future of environmental law will be written not just in parliaments—but in the courts.</p>
