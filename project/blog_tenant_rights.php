    <p><em>Renting a home should be safe, secure, and stress-free. But too often, tenants feel powerless when faced with landlord demands, rent hikes, or surprise visits. The truth is: <strong>you have legal rights</strong> ‚Äî and knowing them is the first step to protecting yourself.</em></p>

    <p>This blog breaks down <strong>what landlords can legally do</strong>, <strong>what they cannot</strong>, and <strong>how to respond if your rights are violated</strong>.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">‚úÖ What Landlords <em>Can</em> Do</h2>

    <h3 class="blog-section-title">1. Raise Rent ‚Äî But With Conditions</h3>
    <p>Landlords can increase rent, but only <strong>after your lease ends</strong>, and with <strong>proper written notice</strong> (usually 30‚Äì60 days depending on local law). They <strong>cannot</strong> raise rent mid-lease unless the contract allows it.</p>

    <h3 class="blog-section-title">2. Enter the Property ‚Äî With Notice</h3>
    <p>Landlords can enter your home for repairs, inspections, or emergencies, but they must give <strong>advance notice</strong> (commonly 24‚Äì48 hours). Emergency situations (like a burst pipe) are exceptions.</p>

    <h3 class="blog-section-title">3. Set Lease Rules and Enforce Them</h3>
    <p>They‚Äôre allowed to include rules in your lease ‚Äî like ‚Äúno pets‚Äù or ‚Äúno smoking‚Äù ‚Äî and enforce them. Violating these terms could lead to penalties or even eviction <em>if</em> the process is legal and documented.</p>

    <h3 class="blog-section-title">4. Evict ‚Äî But Only Legally</h3>
    <p>If you violate the lease (e.g., unpaid rent or major damage), landlords can begin the <strong>formal eviction process</strong>. This involves court procedures ‚Äî they can‚Äôt simply lock you out or throw your belongings outside.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">‚ùå What Landlords <em>Cannot</em> Do</h2>

    <h3 class="blog-section-title">1. Enter Without Notice</h3>
    <p>Your home is your private space. Unless there‚Äôs an emergency, a landlord <strong>can‚Äôt barge in without notice</strong> ‚Äî that‚Äôs a violation of your privacy and rights.</p>

    <h3 class="blog-section-title">2. Evict Without a Court Order</h3>
    <p>Changing locks, removing doors, shutting off power ‚Äî these are all forms of <strong>illegal eviction</strong>. Even if you‚Äôre behind on rent, your landlord must take you to court and follow legal steps.</p>

    <h3 class="blog-section-title">3. Discriminate Against You</h3>
    <p>It is illegal for landlords to refuse to rent based on <strong>race, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation</strong>, or <strong>family status</strong>. This is protected under housing discrimination laws.</p>

    <h3 class="blog-section-title">4. Ignore Repairs</h3>
    <p>You have a right to a <strong>safe, livable home</strong>. That includes working plumbing, electricity, no mold, and secure doors/windows. If your landlord refuses to fix serious issues, you may have legal grounds to report them.</p>

    <h3 class="blog-section-title">5. Retaliate for Complaints</h3>
    <p>If you report a safety issue or file a complaint, your landlord <strong>can‚Äôt punish you</strong> with eviction, threats, or rent hikes. Retaliation is illegal in many areas.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">üì¢ What To Do If Your Rights Are Violated</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Keep copies of texts, emails, lease agreements, and notices.</li>
      <li><strong>Send Written Requests:</strong> Especially for repairs or entry disputes.</li>
      <li><strong>Contact Local Authorities:</strong> Report housing violations to rental boards or tenant unions.</li>
      <li><strong>Get Legal Help:</strong> Legal aid groups or tenant advocacy services often help for free or low cost.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="blog-section-title">üí° Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Your home is more than just a rental ‚Äî it‚Äôs your personal space, and the law protects it. Understanding <strong>what landlords can and can‚Äôt do</strong> helps you make informed decisions, stand your ground when needed, and ensure your rights are never overlooked.</p>

    <p>üõ°Ô∏è <strong>Know your rights. Defend your space.</strong></p>
