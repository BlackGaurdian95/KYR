    <h2>Employment Laws</h2>
    <p>Employment Law covers some of the most personal and life-changing issues you may encounter. From starting a marriage to navigating custody, support, and safety concerns, understanding your rights is crucial for protecting yourself and your loved ones.</p>
    <br>
    <!-- Law Card Example -->
    <div class="law-card">
      <h3>Marriage Rights & Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>Marriage is a legally binding contract with rights and duties. Laws vary by state or country, but typically cover property ownership, inheritance, healthcare decisions, and financial obligations.</p>
      <div class="rights">
        <h4>Your Rights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You cannot be disinherited without a valid signed prenuptial or postnuptial agreement.</li>
          <li>You automatically gain rights to healthcare decision-making for your spouse if they become incapacitated.</li>
          <li>Marital property (anything earned or acquired during marriage) is jointly owned unless stated otherwise.</li>
          <li>You can request court-ordered financial support (maintenance) if separated but not yet divorced.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="law-card">
      <h3>Divorce and Legal Separation</h3>
      <p>Divorce laws govern the ending of a marriage, including how property is divided, debts are handled, and whether spousal support (alimony) is awarded.</p>
      <div class="rights">
        <h4>Your Rights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You have the right to ask for temporary spousal support while divorce is pending.</li>
          <li>You are entitled to an equitable share of marital assets, even if they are only in your spouse‚Äôs name (bank accounts, retirement, property)</li>
          <li>You can request restraining orders (exclusive use of home) if domestic tension escalates.</li>
          <li>You have the right to fair custody arrangements even if your spouse was the "primary caregiver."</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="law-card">
      <h3>Child Custody & Child Support</h3>
      <p>Your child's best interests come first ‚Äî and the law gives you tools to protect them.</p>
      <div class="rights">
        <h4>Your Rights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You can file for joint or sole custody based on the child's best interests (not automatically 50/50).</li>
          <li>You have the right to request child support even without formal divorce or marriage.</li>
          <li>You can seek emergency custody if the other parent poses immediate risk (e.g., substance abuse, neglect).</li>
          <li>You can petition to modify custody/support agreements later if life circumstances change (e.g., new jobs, relocations).</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="law-card">
      <h3>Protection Against Domestic Abuse</h3>
      <p>You are never alone. The law offers urgent remedies to protect yourself and your children.</p>
      <div class="rights">
        <h4>Your Rights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You can immediately request a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) without notifying the abuser.</li>
          <li>Courts can order emergency custody transfers if children are at risk.</li>
          <li>Abusers can be forced out of the shared residence (exclusive possession orders).</li>
          <li>Violation of a restraining order is a criminal offense ‚Äî and police can arrest without a warrant.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="important-note">
      <h4>Important:</h4>
      <p>Family law varies by state, especially in property division, custody standards, and domestic violence protections. Always consult a licensed family attorney for advice tailored to your location.</p>

    <h2>What to Expect in Family Law Cases</h2>

    <div class="law-card">
      <h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Filing Initial Documents</h3>
      <p>You (or your attorney) submit legal petitions to formally open cases for divorce, custody, support, adoption, or protection orders.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="law-card">
      <h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Temporary Hearings</h3>
      <p>Courts may grant urgent, short-term rulings on custody, housing, or financial support while your case is pending.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="law-card">
      <h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ Negotiation</h3>
      <p>Many cases settle outside of court. You have the right to propose parenting plans, support amounts, and property divisions without needing a trial.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="law-card">
      <h3>4Ô∏è‚É£ Trial (if needed)</h3>
      <p>If no settlement is reached, a family court judge makes final rulings based on testimony, evidence, and legal standards for fairness.</p>
